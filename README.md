pyToy
=====
Simple toy I made in Python, made to build/fork off of.

This is a very bare release and I hope to make it bigger.

Installation
============
Make a folder called "pyToy" in your C:\ drive.
Put all files in folder and run "pyToy.bat"

If you don't use the C:\ directory some .bat editing will have to be done. (Sorry!)

IF USING THE BATCH FILE:
To use a different directory (other than C:\pyToy\), edit the following line in "pyToy.bat"

```
cd C:\pyToy\
```

You don't need pyToy.bat file to run the programs. It is just a stylish prompt I made to go to the C:\pyToy\ Directory.
Use the Python command method to run programs.

```
py calculator.py
```
